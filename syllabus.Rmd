# Course objectives

The overarching goal of this course is to promote a critical attitude towards analytical inquiry in Economics and Business. It introduces students industry standard tools and fundamental ideas so they can engage with different kinds of data in appropriately rigorous ways.

Other objectives of the course include:

* Developing students' analytical, quantitative reasoning, and communication skills

* Encourage critical thinking about data and analytical methods

* Prepare students for future careers in data business and economics

* To prepare students to engage upper level economics and business courses

Broadly, the course is organized into three sections. 

1. **Review of Probability and Statistics** The course will begin where Introduction to Statistics (MA005 or equivalent) ended. The review covers descriptive statistics, probability theory, and inferential statistics in one and two variables. It servers also as a platform for learning R, which is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics.

2. **Linear Regression** The main statistical technique in this course is Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), which is a common tool for modeling economic systems and generating forecasts.  In addition to building, interpreting, evaluating OLS regressions, this part of the course explores situations where OLS regression is inappropriate or otherwise inadequate. 

3. **Calculus** The final part of the course will introduce calculus. This section facilitates future classes in the Economics & Business major.

By the end of this course, students will also be able to perform basic data wrangling and visualization tasks. students will also be able to build and interpret OLS regressions using R. Students will appreciate the common failures of the linear model and be able to detect and correct for them. Students will able to use linear regression models to generate forecasts. 

# Prerequisites

Students must have taken MA005, Introduction to Statistics or equivalent in its entirety.

# Resources

1. **This site** Lecture materials and problem sets will be posted to this site.  There will be a link to this page on the [Westmont Canvas site](http://canvas.westmont.edu/) and another link on my [homepage](https://emanlapig.net). 

1. **Textbooks** This class will rely upon two texts. 

    * The introduction to R will come from the (free) text [R4DS](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/)
    * The material covering will be from Econometrics 6th ed. by A.H. Studenmund and published by Addison-Wesley, which is available at the bookstore
    * The calculus material will not rely upon a textbook and many excellent texts exist - please [contact the  instructor](mailto://emanlapig@westmont) for recommendations

1. **Lectures** The main ideas, techniques, and worked examples will be presented during lectures in a workshop style. Students will need a laptop in each class meeting

1. **Office hours** Please feel free to [make an appointment](https://calendar.x.ai/enricomanlapig)







# Assessment

## Examinations

Students will sit three exams (two midterms plus a final) corresponding to the three sections in the course. Examinations are not intended to be cumulative but because the course builds on itself, repetition is unavoidable. Dates, times, locations, and format will be advised although general timing is indicated in the tentative topic schedule below. Examinations are weighted as follows:

1. Probability & Statistics Review: 25%

2. Linear regression: 25%

3. Calculus: 10% (Pass or fail)

*Total grade value: 60%*


## Problem sets

To encourage continuous engagement with the material, students will complete (approximately) two problem sets each week. Students are encouraged to work on these in groups but you must submit individual work. 


1. **Formative problem sets** (worth 17.5%) *will not* be graded for correctness, but rather for both effort and completion

2. **Summative problem sets** (worth 17.5%) *will* be graded for for correctness

*Total grade value: 35%*

## Participation

To ensure regular accountability and create a welcoming learning community, students will participate in several group activities throughout the semester.  These activities will vary from week to week be may include submitting work to public forums, interacting with community partners, and working with groups.

*Total grade value: 5%*

# Policies

### Attendance

Your regular attendance at class is important and expected. Significant and/or consistent absence may result in dismissal from the course with a grade of F.

### Academic integrity 

Dishonesty of any kind may result in loss of credit for the work involved and the filing of a report with the Provost’s Office. Major or repeated infractions may result in dismissal from the course with a grade of F. Be familiar with the [Westmont’s plagiarism policy](http://www.westmont.edu/_offices/provost/Plagiarism/academic_integrity_policy.html||http://www.westmont.edu/_offices/provost/Plagiarism/academic_integrity_policy.html).

Within the context of this course, utilizing resources like Chegg and the work of students that have taken the course in the past are considered violations of academic integrity.  

### Academic accommodations

Students who have been diagnosed with a disability are strongly encouraged to contact the Office of Disability Services as early as possible to discuss appropriate accommodations for this course. Formal accommodations will only be granted for students whose disabilities have been verified by the Office of Disability Services.
