      "contents": "\r\nCourse objectives\r\nThe overarching goal of this course is to promote a critical attitude towards analytical inquiry in Economics and Business. The course focuses on quantitative analytical methods using specialized software.\r\nOther objectives of the course include:\r\nDeveloping students’ analytical, quantitative reasoning, and communication skills\r\nEncourage critical thinking about data and analysis\r\nPrepare students for future careers in data business and economics\r\nTo prepare students to engage upper level economics and business courses\r\nBroadly, the course is organized into three sections.\r\nReview of Probability and Statistics The course will begin where Introduction to Statistics (MA005 or equivalent) ended. The review covers descriptive statistics, probability theory, and inferential statistics in one and two variables. It servers also as a platform for learning R, which is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics.\r\nLinear Regression The main statistical technique in this course is Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), which is a common tool for modeling economic systems and generating forecasts. In addition to building, interpreting, evaluating OLS regressions, this part of the course explores situations where OLS regression is inappropriate or otherwise inadequate.\r\nCalculus The final part of the course will introduce calculus. This section facilitates future classes in the Economics & Business major.\r\nBy the end of this course, students will also be able to perform basic data wrangling and visualization tasks. students will also be able to build and interpret OLS regressions using R. Students will appreciate the common failures of the linear model and be able to detect and correct for them. Students will able to use linear regression models to generate forecasts.\r\nResources\r\nThis site Lecture materials and problem sets will be posted to this site. There will be a link to this page on the Westmont Canvas site and another link on my homepage.\r\nGradescope Problem sets will be submitted to Gradescope\r\nTextbooks This class will rely upon two texts.\r\nThe introduction to R will come from the (free) text R4DS\r\nThe material covering will be from Econometrics 6th ed. by A.H. Studenmund and published by Addison-Wesley, which is available at the bookstore\r\nThe calculus material will not rely upon a textbook and many excellent texts exist - please contact the instructor for recommendations\r\n\r\nLectures The main ideas, techniques, and worked examples will be presented during lectures in a workshop style. Students will need a laptop in each class meeting\r\nOffice hours Make an appointment\r\nAssessment\r\nExaminations (70%)\r\nStudents will sit three exams (two midterms plus a final) corresponding to the three sections in the course. Examinations are not intended to be cumulative but because the course builds on itself, repetition is unavoidable. Dates, times, locations, and format will be advised although general timing is indicated in the tentative topic schedule below. Examinations are weighted as follows:\r\nProbability & Statistics Review: 30%\r\nLinear regression: 30%\r\nCalculus: 10% (Pass or fail)\r\nProblem sets (30%)\r\nTo encourage continuous engagement with the material, students will complete (approximately) two problem sets each week. Students are encouraged to work on these in groups but you must submit individual work.\r\nFormative problem sets (worth 12.5%) will not be graded for correctness, but rather for both effort and completion\r\nSummative problem sets (worth 12.5%) will be graded for for correctness\r\nParticipation (5%)\r\nTo ensure regular accountability and create a welcoming learning community, students will participate in several group activities throughout the semester. These activities will vary from week to week be may include submitting work to public forums, interacting with community partners, and working with groups.\r\nTentative schedule\r\nWeek 1: Introduction\r\nBase R and packages\r\n\r\nWeek 2: Introduction to descriptive descriptive statistics\r\nPackages for data manipulation and visualization\r\nWeb scraping\r\n\r\nWeek 3: Reviewing probability theory\r\nKey theorems in probability theory\r\nMonte-carlo simulation\r\nQuantitative finance\r\n\r\nWeek 4: Reviewing inferential statistics\r\nIntroduces estimators and their properties\r\n\r\nWeek 5: Mid-semester Examination 1\r\nWeek 6: OLS and the Gauss Markov Theorem\r\nSimple and multiple regression\r\nVariance decomposition\r\nOLS\r\n\r\nWeek 7: Hypothesis testing and forecasting\r\nModel evaluation\r\nSignificance testing\r\n\r\nWeek 8: Modeling skills\r\nDummy variables\r\nLog forms\r\nInteraction\r\n\r\nWeek 9: When Gauss Markov fails Part 1\r\nMulti-collinearity\r\nHeteroskedasticity\r\nSerial-correlation\r\n\r\nWeek 10: Spring Break\r\nWeek 11: Selected topics\r\nCategorical data, time series, and/or Endogeneity\r\n\r\nWeek 12: Selected topics\r\nWeek 13: Mid-semester Examination 2\r\nWeek 14: Calculus\r\nWeek 15: Calculus\r\nWeek 16: Calculus\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
