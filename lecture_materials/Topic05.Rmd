# Random variables and probability

.pull-left[
- A random variable is a variable whose value cannot be predicted with certainty

- Random variables can be Discrete or Continuous
]


.pull-right[
- The chance of particular outcomes or groups of outcomes occuring are the probabilities of those events happening 

  
- A probability distribution, $\mathbb{P}(X)$ for a discrete random variable $X$, is an assignment of probabilities to all of its possible outcomes

]

???
* Discrete A discrete random variable has a countable number of values
* Continuous A continuous random variable can take on any value in an interval

For example:
* Number of heads in 3 coin tosses
* My average gas mileage over the last 7 days
* Percent increase in GDP next year

Notice:
While outcomes cannot be known, the chance of those outcomes can be!
For this reason, we can talk about the *distribution* of the random variable. 
Indeed, what we do today is discuss different ways of summarizing distributions instead of talking about random variables themselves. 

For now, let's write down some distributions. To do this, we will use an example.

## Example 1 `r emoji("game_die")`

### A fair six-sided die has six equally likely outcomes.  Each side has a 1/6 probability of occurring.  $$\mathbb{P}(X=1)=\mathbb{P}(X=2)=\cdots=\mathbb{P}(X=6)=\frac{1}{6}$$

???
How can we do this in R?

```{r dice_dist, fig.show = "hide"}
# Define the data

outcomes <- c(1:6) 

probs <- c(1/6, 1/6, 1/6, 
           1/6, 1/6, 1/6) 


# Combine into a dataframe

df <- data.frame(outcomes, probs)


# Tidyverse magic!

df %>% 
  
  ggplot(
    aes(x = outcomes,
        y = probs)) +
  
  geom_col()
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r ref.label = "dice_dist", echo = FALSE}

```

???
* Distributions are governed by parameters. This dice has 6 possible outcomes. The probability of each outcome is 1/6
* The normal distribution has 2 parameters: Means and SD
* t-dist has 1 parameter, df

### Try visualizing the probability distribution of a fair coin 
1. Create a vector of outcomes
1. Create a vector of probabilities
1. Create dataframe to hold the outcomes and probabilities
1. Use `ggplot` to draw a column chart

## 9 heads or 2 heads?

???
The distribution of number of heads is called the Binomial distribution!
$$ \mathbb{P}(X = x) = (^n _x) p^x (1-p)^{(n-x)}$$ where $(^n _x) = \frac{n!}{x!}(n-x)!$

# `r emoji("muscle")` The Law of Large Numbers `r emoji("muscle")`

## The Law of Large Numbers describes the tendency of the empirical frequency approaches the true relative frequency as the number of trials becomes large

.footnote[Technically, this is Borel's Law of Large Numbers!]

???

I Letâ€™s explore with some simulated some dice rolling.
I Roll a 6-six sided die 50 times and plot its empirical frequency
I Increase the number of simulations

The usual (Weak and Strong) Law of Large Numbers say that the sample average from each trial converges to the mean as the sample becomes large. Strong is almost sure convergence. Weak is convergence in probability.

### Let's explore the Law of Large Numbers
1. Have a look at the function `sample()` and use it to simulate 50 rolls of a 6-sided die

1. Use `ggplot` to visualize your data

1. Increase the number of simulations and rerun your simulation - what do you observe?

# Let $X$ be a random variable that can take $N$ possible values.  Its expectation is given by
## $$\mathbb{E}X = x_1 \mathbb{P}(x_1) + x_2 \mathbb{P}(x_2) + \cdots + x_N \mathbb{P}(x_N)$$

The expectation, or mean, of a random variable measures its probability weighted average value

# Expectation rules

.pull-left[
Let $X$ be a random variable and let $a$ and $b$ be constants, then

* $\mathbb{E}a = a$ 

* $\mathbb{E}(aX+b) = a\mathbb{E}X+b$

.pull-right[
Let $Y$ be another random variable, then
* $\mathbb{E}(X+Y) = \mathbb{E}X + \mathbb{E}Y$

* $\mathbb{E}(aX+bY) = a\mathbb{E}X+b\mathbb{E}Y$

.footnote[
But beware! `r emoji("grimacing")`

# Some important expectations


--

### The Mean: $\mu = \mathbb{E}(X)$

--

### Variance: $\mbox{Var} = \sigma^2_X=\mathbb{E}(X-\mu)^{2}\quad$

--

### Standard Deviation: $\sigma = \sqrt{\mbox{Var}(X)}$ 

--

### Covariance: $\mbox{Cov}(X,Y) = \sigma_{X,Y}=\mathbb{E}(X-\mu_{X})(Y-\mu_{Y})$

--

### Correlation: $\mbox{Cor}(X,Y) = \rho_{X,Y} = \frac{\sigma_{X,Y}}{\sigma_X \sigma_Y}$

---
# Important variance rules

Let $X$ and $Y$ be random variables and let $a$ and $b$ be constants, then

- $\mbox{Var}(a)=0$

- $\mbox{Var}(aX)=a^{2}\mbox{Var}(X)$

- $\mbox{Var}(aX+bY)=a \mbox{Var}(X)+b \mbox{Var}(Y)+2ab\mbox{Cov}(X,Y)$

# Expectations matter!

Suppose you hold two stocks, A and B with the following features:

* Stock A's returns, $R_A$, are Normally distributed with a mean (expected) return of 5% and volatility (standard deviation) of 25% (we say, $R_A \sim N(0.05, 0.25)$)

* Stock B's returns, $R_B$, are Normally distributed with a mean (expected) return of 15% and volatility (standard deviation) of 45% (we say, $R_B \sim N(0.15, 0.45)$)

* The two stock returns are negatively correlated with correlation of -80%

If 2/3 of your portfolio is invested in stock A, while 1/3 is invested in stock B, how much can you expect to earn next year?
